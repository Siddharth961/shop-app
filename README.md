# Shopper's Bay

## Description

Shopperâ€™s Bay is a React-based web application that allows users to browse a list of products, manage their shopping cart, and proceed through a checkout process (without handling actual transactions).

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of products with images, prices, and descriptions. Users can add products to their cart.
- **Cart Page**: Users can view and manage items in their cart. They can also proceed to checkout, though no actual transactions will be processed.
- **Local Storage**: The cart data is stored in the browser's local storage to ensure that the cart contents are preserved across page reloads.

## Technologies Used
